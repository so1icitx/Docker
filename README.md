# Docker Mastery:

Welcome to **Docker Mastery**, a hands-on course designed to teach you Docker from the ground up. Docker is the leading platform for containerization, enabling you to package applications with their environments for fast, portable, and reliable deployment. This course is perfect for beginners and intermediate learners, offering clear explanations, practical labs, and real-world examples to help you master Docker.

## Course Objectives
- **Understand Docker**: Learn what Docker is, how it differs from virtual machines, and why it’s a game-changer for development and deployment.
- **Master Core Concepts**: Explore images, containers, volumes, networking, resource management, and Docker Hub.
- **Build Practical Skills**: Pull and run containers, manage persistent data, execute commands, create custom images, and configure networking.


## Why Docker?
Docker makes development and deployment efficient by:
- **Packaging Environments**: Bundle your application with its dependencies (files, variables, permissions) into a single container.
- **Ensuring Consistency**: Run applications identically across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Saving Time**: Eliminate repetitive setup tasks, letting you focus on coding.
- **Boosting Portability**: Deploy containers on any system running Docker, from your laptop to the cloud.

Think of Docker as a shipping container for your code: it carries everything your app needs, ensuring it works the same way everywhere.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into nine modules, each in its own directory with a `README.md`:
1. **Introduction**: What is Docker? Containers vs. VMs, key concepts.
2. **Installation and Setup**: Install Docker on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
3. **Basic Commands**: Pull images, run containers, and manage them.
4. **Volumes and Persistence**: Store data persistently outside containers.
5. **Interacting with Containers**: Run commands, access shells, and view logs.
6. **Building Images**: Create custom Docker images using Dockerfiles.
7. **Networking**: Configure container networking, including offline mode.
8. **Resource Management**: Monitor and limit container resources (CPU, memory).
9. **Docker Hub and Registries**: Share and manage images with Docker Hub and alternatives.

## Prerequisites
- Basic command-line knowledge (e.g., `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`).
- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux (4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended).
- No prior Docker experience required.
- Git installed for cloning this repository (optional).

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository** (optional):
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/so1icitx/Docker.git>
   cd Docker
   ```
2. **Install Docker**: Follow the `02_Installation_and_Setup/README.md` for platform-specific instructions.
3. **Follow Modules Sequentially**: Each module builds on the previous one, with hands-on labs and examples.
4. **Tools Needed**:
   - Docker Desktop (includes GUI and Daemon).
   - Docker CLI (included with Docker Desktop).
   - A text editor (e.g., VS Code) for creating Dockerfiles.

## Learning Tips
- **Use Docker Desktop**: The GUI helps visualize containers, images, and volumes while learning CLI commands.
- **Practice Hands-On**: Run every command in the labs to build muscle memory.
- **Take Notes**: Use tools like Notion to document commands and outputs for quick reference.
- **Experiment Safely**: Containers are disposable, so don’t be afraid to break things and start over.
